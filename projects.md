## Better Video Workflows

The project centered around VizStory, a web-based video-editing tool developed by Vizrt, aimed to explore collaborative video editing and the application of AI techniques in video editing. The research focused on two main goals:

1. Collaborative Editing: The project investigated how various roles in video production, such as producers, editors, and directors, coordinate and communicate during production. It analyzed the effectiveness of different communication methods, including face-to-face interactions, direct messaging, social media, and email. A key aspect was the use of timecodes for feedback and comments, ensuring precise communication and minimizing misunderstandings.
1. Use of AI Techniques: The research examined the potential integration of AI within video editing workflows. While AI had been used to automate trivial tasks and enhance video manipulation, its application in video editing programs remained limited. The project explored how video editors could utilize machine learning to improve their editing processes and workflow efficiency.
