Design practice is changing as Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being integrated into design tools and design workflows. This integration is leading to a redistribution of work within design practice, highlighting how new tools become embedded into existing work practices and the socio-technical changes that follow. From this perspective, the implication of the adoption of AI tools is more than a question of just replacing an old tool with a new one. New tools require adaptations in work practice and involve re-skilling and changes in the distribution of responsibilities. The redistribution of work happens in an ecology of artifacts, which means that some tools might be substituting other tools, or new tools might be integrated alongside the existing tools -- they can hook into each other, but it also can mean that tasks are automated, or it can change the nature of certain tasks. The introduction of such tools and automation can create new demands for invisible work -- tasks that are essential yet often not formally recognized within design processes. Therefore, it is important to look at the design practice as a whole when we want to understand the impact that AI-based tools have on design practice. 

This workshop follows up on the previous workshops that we have conducted. This time, we will focus on understanding the redistribution of work that follows the introduction of AI-based tools in design practice. We see design practice as inherently collaborative and mediated by specialized tools. We also want to focus on the contextual, situated implications of these adaptations and address these as socio-technical changes. 

## Activities

This workshop is planned as an in-person full-day event for approximately 20 participants. The workshop aims to foster a community interested in understanding the socio-technical changes and the redistributions of work that happen in collaborative design practices with the introduction of AI-based tools. We envision this workshop as a platform where researchers and practitioners can share both their published work and work-in-progress.

### Introduction and Participant Presentations

Participants will briefly present their research, experiences, or observations related to AI integration into design practices. Presentations should share insights, anecdotes, or empirical findings about the influence of AI on work practices, highlighting shifts in skills, workflows, and collaboration patterns.

### Group Discussion

In groups, participants will collaboratively develop descriptions of AI integration scenarios based on real-world cases. Groups will document how AI tools affect workflows and collaboration, focusing particularly on instances of redistributed work, emerging responsibilities, and new collaborative dynamics.

### Affinity Mapping

We will collectively engage in a mapping exercise to visualize and analyze how the introduction of AI-based automation leads to a redistribution of work in design practice. This exercise will highlight:

- Invisible work generated by AI-based tools;
- New skills or competencies required from designers;
- Areas where AI integration frees up resources, potentially allowing designers to engage in other creative or strategic activities.

### Research Agenda Development

Drawing insights from discussions and activities, we will identify critical research questions and opportunities around the socio-technical implications of AI in design. Key topics may include the implications of AI tools for collaborative remote and asynchronous work and future directions for research to understand and critically assess the broader impacts of AI on design practice. Following the workshop, we intend to maintain momentum by continuing collaboration and planning further research on these topics.


## Participation


We invite prospective participants to submit contributions in various formats, including brief position statements, encore publications, pre-prints, and pictorials. The accepted submissions will be available to the participants through the workshop website. Contributions may include empirical research, case studies, practical observations, and prototypes of systems leveraging AI for design.

Accepted original submissions will be published on the workshop's website and ArXiv with assigned report numbers. For encore submissions, publication will require permission from both the authors and the copyright holders.

## Workshop organisers

**Pavel Okopnyi**, Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Bergen. His research interests include human-AI interaction, AI applications and tools for professional creative work, and interactive design.

**Willem van der Maden**, Postdoctoral Researcher at the Procedural Expressions Lab (PXL), IT University of Copenhagen. His research focuses on understanding the localized, qualitative experiences people have when interacting with AI systems. This research leverages these insights to inform system-level metrics and improve AI design. With a particular emphasis on generative AI, van der Maden has authored multiple publications in the field and organized two workshops exploring the relationship between generative AI and design at the ACM DIS23 and DIS24 conferences. This interdisciplinary approach bridges the gap between user experience and AI system development, contributing to the advancement of human-centered AI technologies.

**Frode Guribye**, Professor of Information Science. His focus is on HCI and the social implications of information and communication technologies. He has extensive experience in research and innovation projects across areas such as mental health and journalism. He conducts research through design and empirical investigations, aiming to critically and constructively understand the potential and limitations of emerging technologies such as AI and conversational user interfaces.

**Matilda Kalving**, Doctoral Researcher at Tampere University, Finland. Her research focuses on Human-AI collaboration in creative tasks. She is a member of the IHTE Research Group on Human-Centered Technology and the TAUCHI Research Center. In this workshop, she will share insights from her research on the use and design of AI systems that enhance collaboration in creative environments.

**Miroslav Bachinski**, Associate Professor in Information Science. His research focuses on data-driven methods for HCI and interaction beyond the desktop. He has experience designing and developing diverse post-desktop interactive systems, as well as analyzing and modeling them.

**Simone Grassini**, Professor of Psychology at the University of Bergen. His interdisciplinary research spans cognitive psychology, environmental neuroscience, and human-computer interaction, focusing on how individuals engage with both natural and artificial environments.

**Morten Fjeld**, Professor of Human-Computer Interaction at the University of Bergen (Norway) and Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden). His research activities are situated in the field of Human-Computer Interaction, with a focus on tangible and tabletop computing.

**Alejandra GÃ³mez Ortega**, Postdoctoral Fellow, Stockholm University. She works at the intersection of personal data and intimate health. Her research focuses on individual experiences interacting with and sharing intimate data, privacy perceptions and considerations around data, and the data themselves.
