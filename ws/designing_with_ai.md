Can AI replace or augment human capabilities in design? Recent discussions propose that AI-based tools could play significant roles in the interaction process. These tools could specify user contexts and requirements and even generate design solutions in both textual and graphical forms. However, using AI in creative efforts introduces complexities such as content biases and creativity limitations, meaning, AI may require significant human oversight and may not fully substitute human creativity and intuition.

Our workshop aims to delve deeper into the potential and practicality of LLMs in design. We invite researchers, designers, and practitioners to explore:

- The development and effectiveness of AI-based design tools.
- Strategies to mitigate inherent limitations of LLMs.
- How well LLMs can represent user experiences and interpret complex problem spaces.
- The feasibility of LLMs in emulating specific user needs across diverse groups.

## Workshop Themes

- **AI in Design Practice:** Share prototypes, tools, and design ideas. Discuss empirical research and anecdotal experiences with AI-based tools in UX design practice.
- **Beyond Design:** Contributions from fields like writing, music composition, video editing, and illustrating are welcome, reflecting on how AI-based tools are shaping creative processes across domains.
- **Declarative Design:** We will introduce our AI tool, LLMUX, which employs GPT-4 to translate user descriptions into design artefacts. The tool embodies our concept of "declarative design," where designers dictate goals and AI crafts the solutions, marking a shift from direct creation to a more editorial or directorial role of a designer.

## Engagement Opportunities

- **Prototype Demonstrations:** Participants can present their AI-based tools and prototypes and discuss their development and integration challenges.
- **Panel Discussions:** Engage with experts debating the future of AI in design and its impact on traditional roles and processes.
- **Interactive Sessions:** Test and evaluate presented tools and prototypes to experience.

This workshop is an ideal venue for those interested in the cutting edge of design technology and the evolving interface between human creativity and artificial intelligence. Whether you are developing AI tools or researching their implications, join us to share insights and forge collaborations in redefining creative processes.

## Preliminary schedule

* 09:00 - **Workshop Introduction**: Introduction of the workshop’s topic and goal and a short demonstration of the prototype(s) of AI-based tools for interaction design
* 09:30 - **Participants’ presentations and demos**: Participants present their research and demonstrate their projects or prototypes, as well as design cases.
* 10:15 - **Morning break**
* 10:30 - **Ideation, design, and evaluation**: In groups, participants try out the prototypes, providing feedback to assess their functionality, user experience, and evaluate the produced results. For presented design cases, participants can brainstorm and sketch new AI-based tools.
* 11:30 - **Coffee break**
* 12:00 - **Discussion**: in a round table format, participants discuss the practicality of the presented tools, their usefulness and other related topics, such as:
    - What kind of AI-based tools for designers and other creative workers can we develop?
    - How can we deal with the inherent biases in LLMs?
    - How can we assess how well LLMs represent certain groups of users and their needs?
    - What are the roles of AI-based tools in the creative process?
    - Do the current theoretical frameworks and concepts capture the interaction between LLMs and designers (or other creative workers) adequately?
    We will also discuss further publication activity, as we aim to create a publication based on the workshop results.
* 12:45 - **Workshop ends**


## Participation

To attend the workshop, submit a short position paper (1-4 pages, excluding references) in the ACM format. The paper should present your background and a position statement which reflects the ideas, proposals, prototypes, or applications you would like to present during the workshop. Such contributions may include:

- sketches and design prototypes,
- demonstrations of developed tools,
- evaluation or trial reports,
- field studies of the use of AI-based tools,
- research and design proposals.

Accepted submissions will be published online on the workshop website.

**How to submit**: Send your position paper to the email [designing.with.ai.workshop@gmail.com](designing.with.ai.workshop@gmail.com)
