Can AI replace or augment human capabilities in design? Recently, the claim was made that Large Language Models (LLMs) could work as a *database of human experiences* and be a valuable resource in human-centered design processes. If we take this claim at face value it would imply that LLMs could be a proxy for human experiences in terms of representing the needs of future users in an interaction design process. Instead of involving human users, we could then have AI-based tools represent the problem space and create the artifacts, such as personas and scenarios, and in this way replace humans and accounts of their experiences in interaction design. 

In this workshop, we want to put this claim to the test. We will engage critically, playfully and constructively to explore the limits and potential of using AI-based tool in interaction design.

We invite researchers, designers, and practitioners to explore:

- The ideas for how to use AI-based tools in interaction design.
- The development and effectiveness of AI-based design tools.
- Strategies to mitigate inherent limitations of LLMs.
- How well LLMs can represent user experiences and interpret complex problem spaces.
- The feasibility of LLMs in emulating specific user needs across diverse groups.

## Workshop Themes

- **AI in Design Practice:** Share prototypes, tools, and design ideas. Discuss empirical research and anecdotal experiences with AI-based tools in UX design practice.
- **Beyond Design:** Contributions from fields like writing, music composition, video editing, and illustrating are welcome, reflecting on how AI-based tools are shaping creative processes across domains.
- **Declarative Design:** We will introduce our AI tool, LLMUX, which employs GPT-4 to translate user descriptions into design artefacts. The tool embodies our concept of "declarative design," where designers dictate goals and AI crafts the solutions, marking a shift from direct creation to a more editorial or directorial role of a designer.

## Engagement Opportunities

- **Prototype Demonstrations:** Participants can present their AI-based tools and prototypes and discuss their development and integration challenges.
- **Panel Discussions:** Engage with experts debating the future of AI in design and its impact on traditional roles and processes.
- **Interactive Sessions:** Test and evaluate presented tools and prototypes to experience.

This workshop is an ideal venue for those interested in the cutting edge of design technology and the evolving interface between human creativity and artificial intelligence. Whether you are developing AI tools or researching their implications, join us to share insights and forge collaborations in redefining creative processes.

## Preliminary schedule

The workshop will take place on the **13th of October** (Sunday), 2024.

* 09:00 - **Workshop Introduction**: Introduction of the workshop’s topic and goal and a short demonstration of the prototype(s) of AI-based tools for interaction design
* 09:30 - **Participants’ presentations and demos**: Participants present their research and demonstrate their projects or prototypes, as well as design cases.
* 10:15 - **Morning break**
* 10:30 - **Ideation, design, and evaluation**: In groups, participants try out the prototypes, providing feedback to assess their functionality, user experience, and evaluate the produced results. For presented design cases, participants can brainstorm and sketch new AI-based tools.
* 11:30 - **Coffee break**
* 12:00 - **Discussion**: in a round table format, participants discuss the practicality of the presented tools, their usefulness and other related topics, such as:
    - How well do the AI-generated artifacts represent the user needs?
    - How can we use the AI-based tools in a good way, and how to identify and address the shortcomings and limitations of these tools
    - What kind of AI-based tools for designers and other creative workers can we develop?
    - How can we assess LLMs representations of certain groups of users and their needs?
    *The discussions and the artifacts will serve as data material for a paper co-authored by the workshop participants.*
* 12:45 - **Workshop ends**


## Participation

To attend the workshop, submit a short position paper (1-4 pages, excluding references) in the ACM format.
