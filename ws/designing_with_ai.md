Can AI replace or augment human capabilities in design? Recently, the claim was made that Large Language Models (LLMs) could work as a *database of human experiences* and be a valuable resource in human-centered design processes. If we take this claim at face value, it would imply that LLMs could be a proxy for human experiences in terms of representing the needs of future users in an interaction design process. Instead of involving human users, we could then have AI-based tools represent the problem space and create the artifacts, such as personas and scenarios, and in this way, replace humans and accounts of their experiences in interaction design. 

In this workshop, we want to put this claim to the test. We will engage critically, playfully, and constructively to explore the limits and potential of using AI-based tools in interaction design.

We invite researchers, designers, and practitioners to:

- Explore ideas for how to use AI-based tools in interaction design.
- Share prototypes, tools, and design cases.
- Discuss the design and development of AI-based design tools, including strategies to mitigate inherent limitations of LLMs, such as bias and hallucinations.
- Examine the feasibility of LLMs in emulating specific user needs across diverse groups and discuss how well LLMs can represent user experiences and complex problem spaces.

We also invite contributions from fields like writing, music composition, video editing, and illustrating are welcome, reflecting on how AI-based tools are shaping creative processes across domains.

We will demonstate our AI tool that employs GPT-4 to translate descriptions of users into design artefacts. The tool embodies our concept of *declarative design*, where designers dictate goals and AI crafts the solutions, marking a shift from direct creation to a more editorial or directorial role of a designer.

## Preliminary schedule

The workshop will take place on the **13th of October** (Sunday), 2024.

* 09:00 - **Workshop Introduction**: Introduction of the workshop’s topic and goal and a short demonstration of the prototype(s) of AI-based tools for interaction design
* 09:30 - **Participants’ presentations and demos**: Participants present their research and demonstrate their projects or prototypes, as well as design cases.
* 10:15 - **Morning break**
* 10:30 - **Ideation, design, and evaluation**: In groups, participants try out the prototypes, providing feedback to assess their functionality, user experience, and evaluate the produced results. For presented design cases, participants can brainstorm and sketch new AI-based tools.
* 11:30 - **Coffee break**
* 12:00 - **Discussion**: in a round table format, participants discuss the practicality of the presented tools, their usefulness, and other related topics, such as:
    - How well do the AI-generated artifacts represent user needs?
    - How can we use the AI-based tools in a good way, and how we can identify and address the shortcomings and limitations of these tools
    - What kind of AI-based tools can we develop for designers and other creative workers?
    - How can we assess LLMs representations of certain groups of users and their needs?
    *The discussions and the artifacts will serve as data material for a paper co-authored by the workshop participants.*
* 12:45 - **Workshop ends**

## Participation

To attend the workshop, submit a short position paper (no more than 4 pages, excluding references) in the ACM format. The paper should outline your background and a position statement that reflects the ideas, proposals, prototypes, or applications you would like to present and discuss during the workshop. Such contributions may include:

- sketches and prototypes of AI-based tools for design;
  *For example, a prototype for an AI tool that generates user personas based on minimal input, using ChatGPT to simulate user interviews.*
- demonstrations of developed tools;
  *Such as a tool that uses AI to automatically generate wireframes from a brief project description.*
- evaluation or trial reports;
  *For instance, comparing an AI-based tool against traditional methods with real user feedback*
- field studies of the use of AI-based tools;
  *For example, investigating how designers use AI tools to brainstorm ideas, observing how it influenced the creative process in real-time.*
- research and design proposals;
  *An example could be a proposal to develop an AI tool that assists in the ideation phase of design by generating multiple concepts based on initial user requirements provided by ChatGPT.*
- design cases which could benefit from AI-based tools.
  *For example, simulating professional video editors with LLM to better understand their context of work and gather design requirements.*
