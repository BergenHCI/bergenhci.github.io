Can AI replace or augment human capabilities in design? Recently, the claim was made that Large Language Models (LLMs) could work as a *database of human experiences* and be a valuable resource in human-centered design processes. If we take this claim at face value it would imply that LLMs could be a proxy for human experiences in terms of representing the needs of future users in an interaction design process. Instead of involving human users, we could then have AI-based tools represent the problem space and create the artifacts, such as personas and scenarios, and in this way replace humans and accounts of their experiences in interaction design. 

In this workshop, we want to put this claim to the test. We will engage critically, playfully, and constructively to explore the limits and potential of using AI-based tools in interaction design.

We invite researchers, designers, and practitioners to:

- Explore ideas for how to use AI-based tools in interaction design.
- Share prototypes, tools, and design cases.
- Discuss the design and development of AI-based design tools, including strategies to mitigate inherent limitations of LLMs, such as bias and hallucinations.
- Address the feasibility of LLMs in emulating specific user needs across diverse groups and discuss how well LLMs can represent user experiences and complex problem spaces.

We also invite contributions from fields like writing, music composition, video editing, and illustrating are welcome, reflecting on how AI-based tools are shaping creative processes across domains.

We will introduce our AI tool, LLMUX, which employs GPT-4 to translate descriptions of users into design artefacts. The tool embodies our concept of *declarative design*, where designers dictate goals and AI crafts the solutions, marking a shift from direct creation to a more editorial or directorial role of a designer.

## Preliminary schedule

The workshop will take place on the **13th of October** (Sunday), 2024.

* 09:00 - **Workshop Introduction**: Introduction of the workshop’s topic and goal and a short demonstration of the prototype(s) of AI-based tools for interaction design
* 09:30 - **Participants’ presentations and demos**: Participants present their research and demonstrate their projects or prototypes, as well as design cases.
* 10:15 - **Morning break**
* 10:30 - **Ideation, design, and evaluation**: In groups, participants try out the prototypes, providing feedback to assess their functionality, user experience, and evaluate the produced results. For presented design cases, participants can brainstorm and sketch new AI-based tools.
* 11:30 - **Coffee break**
* 12:00 - **Discussion**: in a round table format, participants discuss the practicality of the presented tools, their usefulness, and other related topics, such as:
    - How well do the AI-generated artifacts represent user needs?
    - How can we use the AI-based tools in a good way, and how we can identify and address the shortcomings and limitations of these tools
    - What kind of AI-based tools can we develop for designers and other creative workers?
    - How can we assess LLMs representations of certain groups of users and their needs?
    *The discussions and the artifacts will serve as data material for a paper co-authored by the workshop participants.*
* 12:45 - **Workshop ends**

## Participation

To attend the workshop, submit a short position paper (1-4 pages, excluding references) in the ACM format. The paper should present your background and a position statement that reflects the ideas, proposals, prototypes, or applications you would like to present during the workshop. Such contributions may include:

- sketches and design prototypes,
- demonstrations of developed tools,
- evaluation or trial reports,
- field studies of the use of AI-based tools,
- research and design proposals.

Accepted submissions will be published online on the workshop website.
