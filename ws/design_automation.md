The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), is reshaping the landscape of interaction design by introducing possibilities for automation across various stages of the design cycle. Building on the idea that LLMs can function as a *database of experiences*, this workshop aims to critically examine AI's role in design, exploring how it may augment or challenge human involvement throughout the design cycle. We seek to balance AI's transformative potential with the enduring importance of human contributions, inviting a nuanced discussion on the interplay between artificial and human intelligence in shaping the future of design.

We invite researchers, practitioners, and designers to participate in our full-day on-site workshop on design automation. We welcome both original and encore submissions that explore the role of AI in interaction design. Specifically, we are interested in submissions that present AI-based tools for the design process or cases where AI has been applied in interaction design practice. Contributions may include prototypes, applications, and empirical studies leveraging AI for user research, ideation, prototyping, and usability testing, as well as empirical studies on the effectiveness of AI in design workflows.


## Preliminary schedule

- 9:15 - Introduction of the workshop topic, organizers, participants, and goals.
- 9:30 - Keynote presentation
- 10:15 - Coffee break
- 10:30 - Session 1: AI for Requirements Gathering. In this session, we will discuss the potential of AI to inform the design process by providing adequate requirements. We will explore whether AI tools are capable of accurately representing the needs of various user groups, ensuring that the requirements are inclusive and aligned with diverse user perspectives. We will assign each small group a design case, which they will explore using available AI tools. Participants will use these tools to generate a list of requirements, evaluate the AI-generated outcomes, and reflect on the interaction process -- identifying strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement.
- 12:00 - Lunch break
- 13:00 - Session 2: AI for Ideation. This session will explore the potential for AI tools to assist in the ideation process. We will discuss how AI can help propose novel ideas, organize existing concepts, and support creative thinking, enabling designers to overcome creative blocks and expand their solution space. We will run a short brainstorming session with an AI-companion. The participants will be tasked with evaluating contributions made by AI and its role in the process.
- 14:15 - Coffee break
- 14:30 - Session 3: AI for Prototyping. In this session, we will focus on AI-based prototyping tools and how AI can be used to create mockups of future products, represent design ideas, and generate prototypes suitable for further evaluation and development. Participants will use AI tools to create prototypes (e.g., illustrations, sketches, and diagrams) and assess how well the AI captures design intent.
- 16:00 - Coffee break
- 16:10 - Session 4: AI for Evaluation. In this session, we will examine AI-based tools that can aid in the evaluation phase of the design process. These tools may include automated evaluation systems or AI models that simulate user behavior to provide feedback. We will discuss the reliability of AI-based evaluation methods and whether they can be trusted to deliver insights comparable to traditional user testing.
- 17:15 - Wrap up and further steps
- 17:45 - Workshop ends

## Participation

To participate, please submit an original position paper in the ACM extended abstract format (up to 4 pages long, excluding references), a pictorial (up to 10 pages), or an encore paper (published or in press). The workshop organizers will review the submissions. Accepted original submissions will be published on the workshop's website and ArXiv with assigned report numbers. For encore submissions, publication will require permission from both the authors and the copyright holders.

## How to submit

**TBD**


## Workshop organisers

**Pavel Okopnyi** is a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Bergen. His doctoral thesis was dedicated to the topic of collaboration in video editing. His research interests span various topics in HCI and CSCW, including human-AI interaction and collaborative work. He has an engineer's degree and is a seasoned software developer. 

**Willem van der Maden**, a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Procedural Expressions Lab (PXL) at the IT University of Copenhagen} His research focuses on understanding the localized, qualitative experiences people have when interacting with AI systems. This research leverages these insights to inform system-level metrics and improve AI design. With a particular emphasis on generative AI, van der Maden has authored multiple publications in the field and organized two workshops exploring the relationship between generative AI and design at the ACM DIS23 and DIS24 conferences. This interdisciplinary approach bridges the gap between user experience and AI system development, contributing to the advancement of human-centered AI technologies.

**Frode Guribye** is a professor of Information Science focusing on HCI and the social implications of information and communication technologies. He has wide experience in research and innovation projects across areas such as mental health and journalism. He is doing research through design and empirical investigations, aiming to critically and constructively understand the potential and limitations of emerging technologies such as AI and conversational user interfaces.

**Miroslav Bachinski** is an associate professor in Information Science focusing on data-driven methods for HCI and interaction beyond the desktop. He has experience designing and developing diverse post-desktop interactive systems, as well as with their analysis and modelling. 

**Derek Lomas** is an assistant professor of Positive AI at the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering. He designs data-informed smart systems for human wellbeing, bringing humanist values into AI systems. He is a classicist, futurist, cognitive scientist and proponent of the magic of resonance in design.
