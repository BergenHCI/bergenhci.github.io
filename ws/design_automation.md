The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), is reshaping the landscape of interaction design by introducing possibilities for automation across various stages of the design cycle. Building on the idea that LLMs can function as a *database of experiences*, this workshop aims to critically examine AI's role in design, exploring how it may augment or challenge human involvement throughout the design cycle. We seek to balance AI's transformative potential with the enduring importance of human contributions, inviting a nuanced discussion on the interplay between artificial and human intelligence in shaping the future of design.

We invite researchers, practitioners, and designers to participate in our full-day on-site workshop on design automation. We welcome both original and encore submissions that explore the role of AI in interaction design. Specifically, we are interested in submissions that present AI-based tools for the design process or cases where AI has been applied in interaction design practice. Contributions may include prototypes, applications, and empirical studies leveraging AI for user research, ideation, prototyping, and usability testing, as well as empirical studies on the effectiveness of AI in design workflows.

To participate, please submit an original position paper in the ACM extended abstract format (up to 4 pages long, excluding references), a pictorial (up to 10 pages), or an encore paper (published or in press). The workshop organizers will review the submissions. Accepted submissions will be published on the workshop's website. We expect at least one author of the accepted submission to attend the workshop in person. All participants must register for both the workshop and at least one conference day.

## Workshop organisers

**Pavel Okopnyi** is a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Bergen. His doctoral thesis was dedicated to the topic of collaboration in video editing. His research interests span various topics in HCI and CSCW, including human-AI interaction and collaborative work. He has an engineer's degree and is a seasoned software developer. 

**Willem van der Maden**, a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Procedural Expressions Lab (PXL) at the IT University of Copenhagen} His research focuses on understanding the localized, qualitative experiences people have when interacting with AI systems. This research leverages these insights to inform system-level metrics and improve AI design. With a particular emphasis on generative AI, van der Maden has authored multiple publications in the field and organized two workshops exploring the relationship between generative AI and design at the ACM DIS23 and DIS24 conferences. This interdisciplinary approach bridges the gap between user experience and AI system development, contributing to the advancement of human-centered AI technologies.

**Frode Guribye** is a professor of Information Science focusing on HCI and the social implications of information and communication technologies. He has wide experience in research and innovation projects across areas such as mental health and journalism. He is doing research through design and empirical investigations, aiming to critically and constructively understand the potential and limitations of emerging technologies such as AI and conversational user interfaces.

**Miroslav Bachinski** is an associate professor in Information Science focusing on data-driven methods for HCI and interaction beyond the desktop. He has experience designing and developing diverse post-desktop interactive systems, as well as with their analysis and modelling. 

**Derek Lomas** is an assistant professor of Positive AI at the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering. He designs data-informed smart systems for human wellbeing, bringing humanist values into AI systems. He is a classicist, futurist, cognitive scientist and proponent of the magic of resonance in design.
