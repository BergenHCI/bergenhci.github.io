## Upcoming

### Workshop: Designing with AI at NordiCHI2024 (13 Oct 2024)

Can AI replace or augment human capabilities in design? Recently, the claim was made that Large Language Models (LLMs) could work as a database of human experiences and be a valuable resource in human-centered design processes. If we take this claim at face value it would imply that LLMs could be a proxy for human experiences in terms of representing the needs of future users in an interaction design process.  In this workshop, we want to put this claim to the test. We will engage critically, playfully and constructively to explore the limits and potential of using AI-based tool in interaction design.

### HAID: Human-AI Interaction for Dementia Care at NordiCHI2024 (13 Oct 2024)

Caring for individuals living with dementia can be a challenging and emotionally taxing experience, especially for caregivers who are often spouses or partners. Many caregivers lack prior experience in providing care and would greatly benefit from training and support. With the advancements in AI techniques, human-centered AI interaction approaches have shown promise in enhancing dementia care. As the 1st edition, this workshop focuses on the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI) and artificial intelligence (AI) to address the unique challenges associated with dementia care. Dementia presents multifaceted cognitive and emotional hurdles, and the workshop aims to explore how AI technologies can improve the quality of life for individuals with dementia while also supporting their caregivers. By bringing together researchers, practitioners, caregivers, and stakeholders, the workshop seeks to foster collaboration and innovation in the design, development, and implementation

### MediaFutures Seminar: Heads-up Computing: Towards the next interaction paradigm with Shengdong Zhao, an Associate Professor at the National University of Singapore

Interaction paradigms (the style of interaction between humans and computers) can significantly change the way we work and live. However, as much as we are empowered by interaction paradigms, we are also significantly constrained by them. Existing interaction paradigms limits our movements and activities, which can negatively affect our overall well-being. Desktop computing, described as “sitting at a desk, interpreting and manipulating symbols”, isolates human beings from interacting with other human beings and nature. Mobile computing, although free us from the office environment, demands constant eye-and-hand engagement, leading to the notorious phenomenon called “smartphone zombies”. We need a new style of interaction that can better support human activities in nature and with other people as well as reducing cognitive load by blending reactive operations with appropriately designed proactive initiatives that can offer just-in-time assistance. By carefully redesigning and integrating some of the latest technologies, including wearable computing, sensors, voice-based multimodal I/O, data analysis and prediction, and distributed networking, etc, the new Heads-up Computing interaction paradigm can be designed to work seamlessly with our everyday movements and activities. It allows humans to interact with information while engaging in a variety of activities; therefore, facilitates a holistic lifestyle where essential human needs in work and life can be more seamlessly blended and fulfilled.
